    <p>
      This directory contains the AWS Standalone Deployment Tool which is
      included with the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/">AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio</a>
    </p>

    <p>
    The deployment tool is a command line tool that provides the same functionality as the deployment
    wizard in the AWS Toolkit. The deployment tool can be used in your build pipeline or in other
    scripts to automate deployments to 
    <a href="aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">AWS CloudFormation</a> 
    or 
    <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/">AWS Elastic Beanstalk</a>. 
    </p>

  <p>
    The deployment tool supports initial deployments, redeployments, and
    updates. Redeployment enables you to quickly deploy a new version of your
    application to an already-existing environment. The update
    functionality enables you to make changes to your application
    environment while your application is running. The update
    functionality is available only for CloudFormation deployments.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The deployment tool can be used in conjunction with the deployment wizard
    in the AWS Toolkit. If you previously deployed your application using the deployment tool, you can
    redeploy it using the deployment wizard from within Visual Studio. Similarly, if you
    deployed using the wizard, you can redeploy using the deployment tool.
